# tictactoe-rl
Implement simple tictactoe game in Python with text-based output and learn how to play it using the Minmax algorithm, tabular Q-learning and deep Q-learning with dense and covolutional neural networks using a dual network architecture, dueling network and (prioritised) experience replay. The neural networks are implemented using Keras and TensorFlow. I took inspiration and validated the results with Casten Friedrich's tutorial on implementing reinforcement agents for tictactoe https://github.com/fcarsten/tic-tac-toe.

# Usage

Install requirements via 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Find comparison of different network architectures for three test cases (play second against agent moving randomly, play first against minmax agent, play second against non-deterministic minmax agent) in the Jupyter notebook
